# Systems-and-Control-Final-Project: 

This code written for the Arduino UNO performs proportional feedback control for a Buck Converter with the following design parameters: Input Voltage 7 V, Inductor Value of 500 uH, Capacitor Output ripple of 2.66 %, switching frequency 10 kHz, and duty cycle of 50%. The code utilizes two analog pins of the Arduino (A0 and A1) for the reference voltage and load voltage and a digital pin (D5) for PWM.
